## 💭 Abstract

Travel Tracker allows users to track their trips they schedule through a travel agency. Users can login, track trips they have scheduled as well as add trips. Trips that are added manually are listed as pending.

## 📝  Context
I am a front-end developer who worked through the GitHub project board to complete this application. This project was completed as my final project for Mod 2 of the Front End development program at Turing School of Software & Design.
